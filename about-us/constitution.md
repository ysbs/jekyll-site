Election Procedures

The NEC and Board are responsible for making sure all election and vote procedures are followed.

In multiple winner ERS97 STV elections, an additional question will be included on the ballot paper: "Re-Open Nominations?", with "Yes" or "No" as answers. If a simple majority of voters vote "Yes", the election process will be immediately restarted.

Prior to initiating an election, the Board will appoint a neutral team of election monitors to ensure all elections proceed fairly. This team must contain someone who is neither a candidate standing for election, a member seconding a candidate, nor be currently serving on the Board or the NEC.

Administration and monitoring of the vote may not be undertaken by any official with a direct interest in participants of the election. This includes candidates, nominators and seconders of candidates. Any such official wishing to participate in the election as a candidate, a nominator, or a seconder, may do so by ensuring they have no officiating role in the election.

A vote of no confidence in any elected official will be triggered when either 10% or more of the fully paid-up membership or over 50% of the Governors make their desire for a vote of no confidence known to the Board.

When a vote of no confidence has been triggered the Board will arrange for a vote of party members to ascertain the confidence of the electorate in the elected official, which will conclude within at most 28 days. The officer will be dismissed if a simple majority of eligible members who take part in that vote, vote in favour of dismissal, subject to a quorum of 10% of eligible members.

Voting Eligibility for Votes of No Confidence
